# Fictional Space Probe Data Classification

The aim of the project is to analyse a finctional dataset generated by two space probes that collected data on extra-terrestrial life forms. Given complete samples gathered by probe A, the task consisted of predicting missing information from probe B. To achieve that, a number of machine learning models has been analysed and tested, the most accurate of which will be discussed in the report along with feature engineering techniques employed.

# Content

1. **Feature Engineering**
   - Manual analysis
   - Standardisation
   - Normalisation
   - Surrogate models

2. **Models**
Parameters of the models were selected using Randomised CV hyperparameter tuning.
    - **Classification** \
    Measure: Area Under Curve (AUC)
        * k Nearest Neightbours (k-NN)
        * Random Forest (RF)

    - **Regression** \
    Measure: Coefficient of Determination (R2)
       * Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)
       * Lasso
       * Ridge
       * Lasso + Ridge

1. **Validation**
   - Cross validation (k-fold CV)
